# google-calendar-web-material

This project was dedicated to make the https://calendar.google.com/ site match the modern Material Design. I first created a CSS to make it look so, then I turned to javascript to make it dynamic. If one creates an event, the event's background image will correspond to the image which shows up on the mobile device. Also, the header of my design which is the full width of the screen, will change automatically corresponding to the month, as on mobile devices. This project is my very first own, "from-zero" work, which I am very excited about. It is now downloaded more than 500 times! I learnt the JavaScript in only four days, though it was challenging it made me be sure about that this is something I would like to continue to do as a professional job. I hope you will enjoy it!
